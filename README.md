Welcome to the Friends TV Series website! This project emerged from a simple desire: to create an ad-free platform for enjoying every episode of the iconic show "Friends." Fed up with ads and pop-ups on other streaming sites, I crafted a clean, user-friendly space for me and fellow fans to enjoy the series uninterrupted.

## Project Overview

This project is a single-page web application designed to offer a seamless and ad-free viewing experience for episodes of the Friends TV series. The motivation behind this initiative stemmed from the frustration of encountering intrusive ads and pop-ups on various streaming platforms. This website aims to provide a clean, user-friendly environment while serving as a practical exercise to enhance JavaScript development skills.

## Features

Dynamic Content Loading

The website supports dynamic content loading, enabling users to navigate through different seasons and episodes effortlessly. Each episode is displayed as an interactive card featuring a thumbnail, title, and release date. Clicking on an episode card updates the content on the page without requiring a full page reload, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Custom Routing Mechanism

A key technical challenge in developing this application was implementing a custom routing mechanism for a single-page application (SPA) without relying on external frameworks or libraries. This routing system allows users to move between different sections of the site while maintaining a fluid and uninterrupted experience.

Dark Mode

The application includes a dark mode feature, providing an alternative color scheme for improved readability, particularly in low-light environments. User preferences for light or dark mode are preserved using local storage, ensuring a personalized experience across sessions.

## Project Motivation

The idea for this project emerged while watching episodes of Friends online and experiencing frequent disruptions due to excessive advertisements and pop-ups. Driven by the desire to create a better viewing experience and further develop web development skills, this project was built from the ground up as a personal initiative.

## Technical Implementation

Challenges and Solutions

One of the primary challenges was constructing a custom routing mechanism without the use of frameworks or libraries. The solution involved meticulous state management to ensure that content dynamically updated as users navigated through the website. JSON files were used to organize season and episode data efficiently, while a separate JSON file managed video URLs, allowing for easy future modifications.

Minimal Dependencies

To deepen JavaScript proficiency, the project was developed entirely without external frameworks or libraries. This approach provided hands-on experience with core web technologies, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous content loading.

Video Streaming Source

The videos are streamed directly from a third-party Google Drive shared by a user named "hajxh1" (Drive link: Google Drive). This website does not host any videos; it simply provides an interface for accessing publicly available content. This is a non-commercial project created for educational purposes.

## Contribution

This project was developed as a personal learning experience. However, contributions are welcome. If you wish to improve the website, feel free to fork the repository, make enhancements, and submit a pull request.
